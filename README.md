## 🧭 Brief Background About the Project
Transgender individuals often face challenges finding safe, affirming, and inclusive spaces for everyday needs such as healthcare, retail, and personal care. Many existing platforms lack proper verification or community-driven insight to ensure these environments are genuinely supportive. Transgender Safety & Aid (TSA) addresses this issue by providing a centralized platform that connects users to verified, trans-friendly businesses and services. Through features like community reviews, safe space tagging, and categorization by service type, TSA empowers users to make informed decisions and fosters a stronger sense of safety and belonging within their communities.
